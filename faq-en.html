				<b>Eligibility criteria and voting principles:</b>
				<p>1、	Users who are active within a certain period of time hold a certain number of FACTS Tokens and willing to pledge a certain FACTS Tokens before voting (users are active within a certain period of time refer to users who take part in content production, review and participate other interactions);</p>
				<p>2、	The voting members of content review panel are drawn at random from user pool continuously until a certain number of people among them have completed the judgment. At the same time, refer to the professional domain matching relationship between the user and the content being voted.If the corresponding number of votes has not been completed within the specified time, it will continue to drawn candidates from the user pool;</p>

Only after the party exits the content review panel and all voting contents that this party involves have gone through the appeal period, the FACTS Tokens can be unfrozen.If the party needs enforcement unfrozen, then among rewards that this party has obtained by taking part in voting, the corresponding review rewards in appeal period will be destroyed.</p>
