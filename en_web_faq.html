Truthful and authentic content needs to use reasonable factual content. The FACTS Index is the core parameter that reflects the true and credible content of the content, allowing users to see at a glance.In other words, FACTS is an incentive measure to ensure high-quality output of real content, to solve the problem of the proliferation of false content on the Internet, lack of creative motivation, and low dissemination efficiency.</span>

In the meanwhile, it can also establish community platforms or issue community platform smart contract tokens. The smart contract tokens may distribute the revenue that comes from the content incentive and reward mechanism to every link of the collecting and editing agency by smart contracts fairly. Use the content pool of FACTS to provide more trustful and effective content basis for the contents of the platforms and these contents will also provide more trustful and high quality content precipitation for the FACTS content pool.<br/>
                    FACTS foundation will form strategic partnership with Shiliu Blockchain Financials, the emerging vertical media platform founded by a most professional team that has been working on financial media industry for more than 15 years.

                <span class="descqq" >5. What are the principles for the selection and voting of the Investment Commission?</span>
                <span class="desc">The content voting committee is the control agency of FACTS contents. The members of content voting committee are generated by the principles of justice and transparency. Each piece of content generated in the network needs to be voted by content voting committee for determining whether it can be presented in DApp or not.</span> 
                <span class="desc">Eligibility criteria and voting principles:</span> 
                <span class="descsub">1. Users who are active within 7 days hold a certain number of FACTS Tokens and willing to pledge a certain FACTS Tokens before voting (users are active within 7 days refer to users who take part in content production, review and participate other interactions);</span>
                <span class="descsub">2. The voting members of content voting committee are drawn at random from the 7 days active user pool continuously until a certain number of people among them have completed the judgment. If the corresponding number of votes has not been completed within the specified time, it will continue to drawn candidates from the user pool;</span>
                <span class="descsub">3. The content voting committee obtains FACTS Tokens. The content voting committee follows their rules to vote. The party with the voting proportion of more than 60% will obtain the tokens. In the judging period, if they are reported by users and the report is passed by new term content voting committee, then their original token rewards will be deducted and these tokens will be given to another party.</span>
                <span class="desc">The pledged FACTS Tokens cannot be transferred or segmented. Only after the party exits the content voting committee and all voting contents that this party involves have gone through the appeal period, the FACTS Tokens can be unfrozen.If the party needs enforcement unfrozen, then among rewards that this party has obtained by taking part in voting, the corresponding review rewards in appeal period will be destroyed.</span>

            <li>
                <span class="descqq" >6. What is the Appeal period?</span>
                <span class="desc">A piece of content will obtain rewards after the expiry of evaluation period. In order to have enough time to identify infringement, trustfulness and other behaviors, the authors shall obtain the rewards after a certain period of locking-up.<br/>
                    In order to prevent malicious authors from releasing infringement or violation contents, users can launch a new term content voting committee by initiating content reporting complaints. This kind of contents can be frozen according to the voting result of content voting committee, which the frozen contents will not be able to continue to receive evaluation and the authors will fail to obtain the revenue that can be obtained under normal conditions as well. During the appeal period, content authors also have the right for arbitration and appeal, which ensures that all users are able to be treated fairly.<br/>
                    Time is one of the most important indexes for verifying content trustfulness, too. FACTS adds a relatively long appeal period to ensure there are sufficient evidences to prove the trustfulness of contents before they enter the content pool.</span>

                <span class="desc">This project will develop a set of content public chains based on the existing blockchain mature public chain and distributed file storage projects. The entire project will be divided into three levels: the base chain layer, the transaction layer, the content management layer, the protocol layer, and the application layer. The requirements for each level of the system's infrastructure, content management, and content applications will be clearly defined.<br/>
                    At the infrastructure level, core operations such as currency trading, content storage and packaging of blockchain cores will be established.<br/>
                    At the level of content management, FACTS Graph and FACTS Index will be established based on artificial intelligence algorithms, and high-quality content-driven logic will be established using Proof of FACTS (PoF).<br/>
